# Problem state
- Chest x-rays are the common method used to diagnose pneumonia and it takes a medical expert to assess the result of the x-ray. The troublesome method of detecting pneumonia leads to loss of life due to improper diagnosis and treatment.

- With the emerging computing power, the development of an automatic pneumonia detection and disease treatment system is now possible, especially if the patient is in a remote area and medical services are limited.
